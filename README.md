## Project Summary

Maven Tech, a computer hardware company, had recently adopted a CRM system to monitor its sales pipeline. However, managers lacked the ability to efficiently analyze quarterly trends, agent performance, and regional outcomes due to the limited analytical capabilities of the CRM platform.

To address this gap, I developed an interactive sales performance dashboard in Google Sheets. The tool enables managers to track key metrics, assess individual and team performance, and uncover actionable insights across time, region, and role.

## Business Objective

Enhance visibility into CRM sales data to support data-driven decision-making, improve agent accountability, and identify regional sales opportunities.

## Analytical Process

### 1. Data Preparation
- Integrated CRM sales pipeline data with team, region, and manager attributes.
- Conducted data profiling to ensure accuracy in won/lost opportunity tracking.

### 2. Sales Analysis
- Used pivot tables to evaluate quarterly win/loss trends.
- Ranked agents by won opportunities and structured data for real-time monitoring.

### 3. Dashboard Development
- Built a dynamic Google Sheets dashboard featuring:
  - **Scorecards**, **bar charts**, and **pie charts** for at-a-glance insights.
  - **Slicers (filters)** for manager and region-level drilldowns.
  - **Trend comparisons** to evaluate quarter-over-quarter progress.

## Key Insights

- **Quarterly Trends:** Q4 2017 saw a 3.4% decline in closed deals compared to Q3, but annual performance remained strong with 1,200+ wins per quarter.
- **Top Performers:** Agents like Darcel Schlecht and Vicki Laflamme consistently led, while others underperformed significantly, highlighting opportunities for targeted coaching.
- **Conversion Rates:** The overall win rate stood at 60.3%, with lost deals often tied to pricing, competition, or negotiation delays.
- **Regional Variation:** Slicers revealed meaningful differences in regional and managerial performance, enabling strategic resource reallocation.

## Outcome

The dashboard provided managers with real-time visibility into sales operations, empowering them to:
- Monitor team and individual performance.
- Identify coaching opportunities.
- Make informed decisions at regional and organizational levels.

This initiative transformed raw CRM data into a scalable performance tool that supports continuous improvement and revenue growth.
